# Solution

Compile: g++ main.cpp -o main.out  
Run: ./main.out *game* *number_walks*  
Example: ./main.out 1 1000  
Input: the program places food as in Q1, Q2, Q3 (*game* = 1, 2, 3 resp.) and runs a number *number_walks* = 1, 2, ... of ant's walks.  
Output: average and standard deviation of a walk's time

Q1) We corroborate the average time of 4.5 seconds.  

Q2) The average time is large and fluctuating, which agrees with an infinite result.  

Q3) The average time is 14 seconds. One may write and solve the equations to corroborate.
